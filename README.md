- Dynamic content generated with JS
- View the app on all devices
- The app is accessible to as many different users as possible.

## APIs used

- [Companies House API](https://www.api.gov.uk/ch/companies-house/#companies-house)
- [Pexels image/video API](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/)

## Idea 

Our website is ideal for potential entrepreneurs who would like to start thinking about the name and image of their new brand. 

Based on the user's query name, the site checks the Company House API to see if a company with that name exists. If the name is available, the image API is queried to suggest a possible logo.
